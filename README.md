This is an Open Project to learn about Level Design and Game Architecture. 

it is early days, I am doing this as part of a game design class I am teaching to some students. 

for now the main objective is to replicate the features and level design from this great talk:
[Spatial Communication in Level Design by Peter Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKeUZVikPV8&t=2s&ab_channel=PeterField)

the first person controller was inspired by this other repo: 
[First Person Drifter](https://github.com/igaryhe/FirstPersonDrifter/tree/master)
